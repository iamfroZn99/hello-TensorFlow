# hello-TensorFlow

This is my first time training a TensorFlow model on my own. Well it doesn't really do anything except for looking really cool in the terminal.
Runs for 50 epochs basically improves itself 50 times

So yeah sweet dreams

hello-TensorFlow, see what I did there?

Make sure you’ve got TensorFlow installed.
Just type pip install tensorflow in the terminal and let the magic begin
